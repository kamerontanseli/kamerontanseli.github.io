Sick of protein shakes and oats? Make hitting your protein target a fancy affair with this protein raspberry panna cotta

## Ingredients

* 270ml light coconut milk
* 2 scoops Impact Whey Protein (Vanilla)
* Sweetener of your choice
* 100ml water
* 1 sachet gelatine (7g)
* ½ tsp. vanilla extract
* 180g raspberries

## Method

1. Combine coconut milk, water, and the 2 scoops of whey into a blender or protein shaker and mix till it's lump-free.

2. Pour into a bowl with gelatine – leave for a few minutes before mixing, then add the vanilla extract along with a sweetener of your choice for taste.

3. Transfer to a saucepan, on a low heat gently warm up the liquid to melt the gelatine (do not let it boil).

4. Pour into 1 large ramekin or 2 ramekins, and place in the fridge to chill for a minimum of 4 hours or overnight.

5. Meanwhile, prepare the raspberry sauce by blending the raspberries in a blender and then straining through a sieve to remove the seeds. Chill in the fridge.

6. Once the panna cotta has set, serve by carefully flipping the ramekin over a plate. Cover with the strawberry sauce and a few extra strawberries for a finishing touch.
