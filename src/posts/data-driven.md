Back to when I was 18 at [Motivii](https://motivii.com/), we were an incredibly small and lean startup, we had a TV on a wheely stand with [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) stats listed on it that would reflect how many updates our users were submitting each week. 

I remember walking in every monday morning and seeing how well we did compared to last week. It was motivating, every business decision we made was around one central metric: _# of Weekly Updates Submitted Per Week_. We developed tasks, OKRs, and status updates but cleanly rolled them into a single update that a user had to do on a Friday evening. We only built those features not because we saw the future of relationships but because customers asked for them.

The result? Customers loved our product. Every week we'd get an email from a manager or a direct report of some company, telling us how much they loved our product and how it solved a personal problem they had at work.

Data driven startups are a rarity, built from the start by a culture of being able to be wrong. They allow anyone inside the company to AB test their ideas without being shot down by [HIPPOs](https://exp-platform.com/hippo/), they're able to understand the health of the business in an instant and collectively move teams together to increase one singular goal. **Most importantly, they don't ship features that hurt their core company goal.**

## How do I build a data-driven company?

If you're the CEO/CTO/CPO/CFO etc then get your company to:

1. Figure out what metric accurately reflects your product solving your customer's pain points.

2. Make teams and people accountable for moving that metric by X% by a specific date.

3. Install an [AB testing](https://www.statsig.com/) tool into your product.

4. AB test new features against the metric in step 1.

5. Understand why the feature didn't move the needle and repeat step 4 again.

6. Keep going until that metric moves in a [significantly positive direction](https://www.dynamicyield.com/lesson/bayesian-testing/).

7. Setup a sharing platform so that teams can post about what they learnt or why features didn't work.

8. Repeat steps 4-7
