I moved to London when I was 18. Packed up my stuff and moved into a tiny apartment just south of Camden Town. It was exciting although my first apartment was a shit show of a place.

I've made so many friends and memories since then. Worked for 3 amazing startups (Motivii, Flux, and Tray.io) and completely changed my health and mindset in life.

## So why am I leaving?

January this year I decided to travel and work (this was before all the covid stuff had happened). I picked Porto, Portugal as my first destination. I didn't quit my job or take time off at all, this was going to be an experiment to see if remote working while abroad was really the answer to living an exciting life.

**The experience was life changing.** I lived a luxurious life while working from there. Ubers across the city cost £2-3 which was the same cost as taking the public transport in London. Coffee was 60% cheaper, my AirBnB cost me £500 per month to live from, compare that to my London apartment where I pay £950 for a room!

## So am I moving to Porto then?

No. One of the things I've always had on my bucket list is to live in Turkey for a few months of the year. Why? Because I'm actually half Turkish! I've always wanted to learn the language and learn more about the culture/way of life. After comparing the cost of Istanbul to Porto I decided both would save me money regardless. So it was a choice of which place do I want to visit more.

## Earn in £. Spend in Lira

**Let's not forget one very important upside to living in Istanbul. Currency.** The Lira has tanked in the last few months. The Turkish economy has been struggling to grow, and the current war along the east border has caused the currency to devalue. Compare that to Portugal where they are tied to the Euro which has grown steadily stronger compared to the pound.

So what does this mean? It means I get paid in British Pounds (for e.g: £55k) and then when I spend money, it will be in Turkish Lira (for e.g: £55k &rarr; 575,280TL). That means that my spending power will be dramatically increased (very 4 hour work week right?).

Here's the average living prices in Istanbul:

* The average monthly rent for an apartment in Istanbul is 6,000TL (£573).
* The average price of a meal for 2 people in a mid-range restaurant is 75-150TL (£7-14).
* The average price for a Cappuccino is 8-15TL (76p-£1.43).
* The average monthly price for a gym is 156TL (£15).

Compare that to my London living expenses:

* My monthly apartment cost is £950 (9,937TL) for a room.
* I normally spend £50-75 (523-800TL) just on myself when I go out to eat at a restaurant.
* Cappuccinos cost £3.50 (36TL).
* My gym is a luxury gym which I pay £175 (1,830TL) a month for.

So if I do some basic math `rent + (1 meal out a week) + (1 coffee a day) + gym`:

* London: `£950 + (£50 x 4) + (£3.50 * 30) + 175 = £1,430 (14,958TL)`
* Istanbul: `£573 + (7 x 4) + (0.76 * 30) + 15 = £638 (6,673TL)`
* Total savings: `£1,430 - £638 = £792 extra a month`

It's a no brainer really if you think about it. I'll be able to double what I'm currently saving and use the extra funds to maybe launch a business.

## So when is this happening?

Right now I'm stuck due to COVID-19. However next year seems promising with the vaccine and current lockdown measures. My guess is probably August though I'd really like to escape London in March/May time.
