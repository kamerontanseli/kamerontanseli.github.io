I'm no stranger to challenges. In fact, my best work tends to come out when I'm compressed into time limits. For example, I managed to create a #1 on HN article, ["First, it was Craigslist, next it's Zapier"](/blog/first-it-was-craiglist-next-its-zapier), only after challenging myself to write one blog post for 30 days.

So why 12 startups in 12 months? Because this year has been a boring one. My vision for remote working involved more Airbnbs in Istanbul rather than an all-inclusive at _Le Apartment_.

Furthermore, being stuck inside all the time isn't great for my creativity. I ended up not wanting to work on products and opted more for activities outside of my laptop like cooking, bodybuilding, and hiking. Which meant that my discipline and routine for building validated products started to slip.

## Those who came before me

Over the last weeks I ended up binge watching/reading content on [Pieter's blog](https://levels.io). One of the things that really stood out to me was his necessity to do the uncomfortable. Comfortable was exactly the thing I had become over this year and his 12 startups in 12 months challenge was the perfect antidote to that.

His blog lead me onto numerous other blogs which have also tried this challenge:

* [Monica Lent](https://monicalent.com/12x-startup/)
* [Yong Fook](https://blog.yongfook.com/12-startups-in-12-months.html)
* [Tom Kadwill](https://tomkadwill.com/12-startups-12-months)
* [Ben Stokesy](https://tinyprojects.dev/)
* [Sean Walker](https://medium.com/@swlkr/im-shipping-12-startups-in-12-months-f70266a50cef)
* [GJ Trowbridge](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/category/blog/projects/the-levels-challenge-build-12-startups-in-12-months/)
