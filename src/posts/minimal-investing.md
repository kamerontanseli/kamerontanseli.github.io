> Investing isn’t about beating others at their game. It’s about controlling yourself at your own game - **Benjamin Graham,** The Intelligent Investor

Today I made the decision to stop individually investing in stocks and instead focus entirely on diversified funds.

Why? Well theres three reasons...

Firstly with **the recent unemployment figures, ease of access to the stock market (Robinhood), and COVID-19.** 

I couldn't help but think back to the recklessness of previous financial crises like in 2008 when [mortgage bonds were all time high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) even though they were buit on worthless loans. 

Secondly **I spent an ungodly amount of time managing and picking stocks which ate away at my attention.** I opened up my trading app more than fifteen times a day.

Thirdly I realised **my investments were driven by emotions**. The constant speculating and buying/selling resulted in less gains.

**Note**: Individual stocks made up 10% of my savings and returned a solid 9% during COVID-19 troubles. 90% of my savings are held in a diversified bonds/stocks [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-gb/) account which on average returns 7% every year.

### So What's Next?

I'm using Wealthsimple to merge my pension, current stocks & shares ISA, and the money from my stock trading to create  a larger pot.

This larger pot based on the 7% average growth rate every year should compound nicely over the next 30 years and provide an adequate buffer for the troubling times ahead.
