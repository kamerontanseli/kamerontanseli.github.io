title: "You have four hours"
---

I'm going to keep this post short and simple.

Your day is around eight to ten hours. Three to four hours of which are spent eating.

That leaves you with around four to six hours to live your life every day.

If someone is stressing you out or you feel like they are drifting away from you. Let them go. Do not let them waste your precious four hours a day that you have to better yourself and live the life you want.

If your work makes you feel stuck and doesn't excite you anymore. [Find a way to go remote](https://tim.blog/tag/remote-working/). Save those two hours a day commuting, work on something that makes you happy, and brainstorm how you can change that into your career.

Most importantly be very disciplined with your time. [Jocko Willink](https://twitter.com/jockowillink?s=20), former Navy Seal, puts it succinctly:

> Discipline equals freedom

The more we control our lives the more we can change the outcome of each day. It's only when we stop and fight for the life we want to live does it actually happen.
