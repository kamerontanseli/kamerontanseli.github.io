title: "What's missing with No-Code"
---

I Â recently [built an app](https://gsheet2mail.com) to help No-Coders create automated Mailchimp newsletters using Google Sheets. Along the way I thought to myself about how the same app I was creating could of all be done without code...

Here's a few areas which I believe are yet to be done perfectly:

## Authentication

The app required a Google OAuth login to access spreadsheet data. A No-Code app which could act as a user authentication layer for Zapier or Tray.io workflows would help alleviate a lot of the pain for No/Low-Code apps right now.

## Dynamic UI

Full responsive dynamic UI is a hard problem to solve. I'm aware of some amazing Webflow websites coming out but I still think a lot of those websites are lacking some sort of dynamic widget for displaying data (other than an Airtable embed).

## Web Scraping

Building an automated web scraping no-code tool would open up a lot of opportunities for more news/currency/linkedin websites to appear. It would be as simple as posting to a webhook for zapier or appending rows to a Google Sheet for it be useful for No-Coders.
