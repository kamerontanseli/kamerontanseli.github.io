> An actionable metric is one that ties specific and repeatable actions to observed results. - [LeanStack](https://blog.leanstack.com/3-rules-to-actionable-metrics-in-a-lean-startup/#:~:text=An%20actionable%20metric%20is%20one,or%20what%20to%20do%20next.)

No matter if you're a tech SaaS company or a bakery. You should have metrics at hand which displays the performance of your business.

These metrics should be in the format of a time-series so you can compare periods and react to changes in a weekly/biweekly/monthly basis.

## Finding actionable metrics for your business

**1. What action is core to your business model?**

_Facebook relies on users spending time on their site, so improving **Avg Session Time** would impact their Ad Earnings_.

_An Instagram Page relies on followers clicking their bio link to buy their merch, so improving **Bio Link CTR** and **Website CR** would increase their e-commerce earnings._

**3. Now set a cadence for it (i.e: daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly)?**

_If your business has customers that only visit you once a month then set a monthly cadence._
