Work should be thought of as an extension of our creative ability. We create and share our artistic talent with the wider world in order to solve a problem.

Work therefore should be inherently flexible and allow us to freely move around and explore all creative avenues and problems. But unfortunately in the modern world, we seldom have the opportunity to do such a thing.

That’s why I think we’re beginning to see an explosion in the rise of entrepreneurialism. Yes, times are hard and we all want a side hustle to pay the bills. But if we look deeper, the core issue at hand is the fact that our 9-5 jobs are rigid and don’t give us the space to explore problems that we find interesting.

As a society, we’ve optimised human work to a point where a single career can be deemed successful even though the job is doing the same thing all day every day for the rest of time. That right there is insanity.

Let’s use the hyper specialisation of tech jobs right now. A front end engineer should only care on the front end of the product. They should spend their time researching the new JS frameworks, UI principles, and upcoming web standards. However, a front end engineer should not be running analysis on user behaviour, building out new API routes, or talking and selling to customers.

At companies of significant scale if a front end engineer was to step outside their designated role he or she would be told to focus on their current tasks of the sprint and leave that exploratory work to marketing or UX.

That’s where I believe bigger companies have gone wrong. Yes, people are inherently better at doing one thing. But, they should never just do that one thing 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.

Small companies, however, have the right formula. You see, at a small company you’ll often end up wearing numerous hats. Designers will code, engineers will do support, CEOs will be project managers etc. Due to a lack of resources, you open up the possibility for people to try new things and often that’s where innovation lies. Startups and small companies end up creating new job roles such as Growth Hacking or Growth engineering for two job categories that otherwise wouldn’t have been combined without that kind of flexibility.
