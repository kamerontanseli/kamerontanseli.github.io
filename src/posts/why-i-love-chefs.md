I've been struggling to write these past couple of days. My mind has been scattered focusing on work at [Tray.io](https://tray.io) and [gsheet2mail.com](https://gsheet2mail.com). So apologies for not posting yesterday.

One thing that has kept me sort of sane during this lockdown is watching Macro Pierre White's early days in the kitchen. For those not aware of Marco Pierre White. You might know his apprentice. Gordon Ramsey.

I'm just in awe with the way Marco, at every level, strives for perfection. For example, Marco would go and inspect the fish and meat at his local fisheries and butchers to ensure quality.

**His real secret is only doing simple dishes, 7 ingredients or less, and having a falcon-like focus on each part** of the meal to create something extraordinary.

Deep down I also strive for that level of perfection in what I do. I'm aware I lack skill in certain areas, but much like Marco **I can make it easier on myself by focusing on very niche problems and aiming to get the UX perfect over the UI.**

I may not be making Michelin Star products yet. But give me some time and some Oregano and I'll get there ;)

## Little Bit Extra

I've been learning how to cook! I'm following the [4 Hour Chef](http://fourhourchef.com/) course to improve my understanding of food. Safe to say I now eat and smell everything around me.

Even if you're not into cooking, [theres an article in the book](https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/?_ga=2.208163413.671466442.1588679855-707646601.1584391076) around finding business ideas which I recommend.
