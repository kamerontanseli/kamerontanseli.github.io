It's easy to tell the world you're going to create 12 startups, it's not so easy to actually come up with 12 ideas to build and launch. So after my announcement to Twitter, I used [Yong Fook's startup idea evaluation spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yUlKlL8MIxlgSNH0t-aDKPVdrDhFSSb_0pVdk-f0qIE/edit?usp=sharing) to just quickfire off some ideas.

One of those ideas aligned well with my growth engineering background. For context I built most of the form technology that you see used on [Tray.io](https://tray.io), so it made perfect sense for me to solve a problem around forms and conversion.

_I've highlighted the important points in bold below_

## So what's the problem?

**Startups need to retain customers** by finding a way to contact them after they launch. This isn't a new or particularly niche problem, which is great as the problem doesn't need to be validated.

## The Solution

**Email banner pop-ups are an effective way of collecting emails** during a launch. For e.g: Nomad List and Remote Ok all used email banners to turn hundreds of early visitors into users.

## How I can help

**[Readercatch](https://readercatch.com/) creates email banner pop-ups** that can be installed on a startup's landing page with one line of code.

## How is it different to X?

**Readercatch focuses solely on email banners, where as other vendors offer a whole range of pop-ups.**

**Readercatch works best for small-mid size startups** looking for a simple solution to creating a banner pop-up.

## Progress

### Tue 15th December

- **[MVP](https://readercatch.com/) is 95% complete**. Users can create, install, and send leads to Mailchimp via an email bannner. Stripe and Mailgun is setup to handle the upgrade flow when a user hits the 500 cap.

- **I've already pivoted**. Readercatch used to be an email widget that got installed within an article but I decided to scrap that idea as it was too complex and niche to sell to startups.

- **Marketing site is nearly finished**. [The marketing site](https://readercatch.com/) is 90% done, just need to film a video of me setting up a banner and it's ready to go.
