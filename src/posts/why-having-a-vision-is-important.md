Vision is something that you internalise. There is a moment in your life where you sit yourself down and you ask yourself "What do I want to be?".

If you sit there and draw blanks. It's not your fault, as an adult we tend to forget crazy ideas in favour of comforting reality. We toss our childhood dreams aside and focus on the present.

Our vision defines us and shapes what we do every day. It gives us the desire to be something more.

## Habits

Habits are something that you do every day/week/month. Most people tend to add habits to their life. Without a goal, those habits have no meaning. They dissipate over time and you end up back at square one.

It is the vision that gives you the push to change your life, not the habits.  **Vision determines habits.**

I'm not alone with this observation. James Clear author of Atomic Habits said it best:

> “The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.”  ― James Clear, Atomic Habits

## Defining your vision

At this point, you know how important vision is to success. Now it's time to define your vision.

I'm going to ask you a series of questions. I want you to think long and hard about each one:

### Who is someone you idolise and why do you idolise them?

For example, my idol is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Not only did he become a real estate mogul, bodybuilder, and top paid actor but he also became the governor of California.

### What is something you've always wanted to do/be but fear or judgement has held you back from achieving it?

For example, I was always afraid of gyms growing up. I felt stupid working out. It wasn't until I lived by myself and tried out weightlifting did I discover my new favourite activity.

### When you were 12 what did you think you'd be when you got older?

For example, As a child I was in love with science and computing. I wanted to be a scientist and discover things. In a way I guess that came sort of true with me becoming a Growth Engineer

### Now time for your vision: If you couldn't fail. What would do? Who would you become?

When I say the word "Success" what comes to your mind. Forget the cars, houses and fat stacks. Instead focus on who is the person that is successful?

## Achieving your vision

It's not enough to write your vision down and forget about it. In our modern world we become busy, distracted, and ultimately end up back to our old selves.  **What you need is to be reminded.**

Having supportive friends that keep you in check is one of the most effective ways in reaching your vision. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger wouldn't be the best bodybuilder of all time without his training partner, Franco Columbo, to push him to be better.

However relying solely on your friends will not guarantee success. You also need to have that internal drive to be better. Your friends are there to top up your motivation and provide help when necessary.

**Note: If your friends don't support your dreams then they are not your friends.**

Every Monday take 5 minutes to ask yourself  _"what can I do this week that will help me progress towards my vision?"_. Write down the tasks you need todo in order to solidify them in your mind.

As an extra bonus mention your progress to your friends. Every 3-4 days send them an update on your progress. Not only does this give you drive to continue but you are also inspiring your friends to be better.
