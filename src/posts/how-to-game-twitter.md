### Observations made from looking at my own stats

Replying to a thread gave 3x the impressions and 3x engagement.

Tweets with other accounts mentioned in them performed better.

The subject of finding business ideas is trending for my audience understandbly.

Tweets posted before working hours saw the most engagement and impressions.

### How to write a Tweet (based on industry research)

When tweeting, offer a brief takeaway and quicks links to more resources for those interested:

> "just ate a burrito. Mmmm… good,” consumes the readers valuable attention without adding value.

> “Just had an incredible mahi-mahi burrito at [best unknown taco stand] in San Diego. Must-eat: www.website.com In NYC, try: www.website2.com” is actionable and provides a to-do for your followers.

**If you include a question, using it to begin the Tweet will increase click-through.**

**The most common words in top-30 most-clicked Tweets: how to…, best, most, worst, great.**

Some example top performing tweets:

> he best job in the world – seriously – is taking applications now: http://tr.im/62yw Thanks, MJ! (www.minjungkim.com)

> Want to remember everything you’ll ever learn? Use this algorithm: http://tr.im/bnsa Thanks, Gary Wolf + readers, for reminding me 🙂

> The most incredible fat-loss photos you will ever see: http://tr.im/cwlw

### When to post on Twitter (based on industry research)
