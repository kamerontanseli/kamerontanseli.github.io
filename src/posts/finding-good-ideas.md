Since my last article I've been getting a lot of questions on Twitter on how to find business ideas. I'm no guru myself but I do end up with a lot of SaaS ideas (almost daily at this point).

> [@KameronTanseli](https://twitter.com/KameronTanseli?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Hi, please suggest some idea that a single developer can make, that make $100 per month.

To name a few ideas I've had recently...

*   A discovery site for accessing paid, membership-only Slack groups
*   Slack command to buy a slack space owner a Coffee
*   Founder Chats, weekly recorded zoom calls with my founder friends where we review a maker's new product.
*   Printable Meal Plans from a Google Sheet (PTs love using Google Sheets for everything)
*   [Buy & Sell Zapier Workflows](http://copythatworkflow.com/) on an Online Marketplace
*   [A journal based on Fear Setting](http://thefearsettingjournal.com/) by Tim Ferriss

Okay, the last two I'm acting on but you're free to take the rest :)

## Generating your own Ideas

In the past [I have talked about how to come up with better niche ideas](/if-you-want-to-have-great-startup-ideas-then-be-a-weirdo/). Since then I've read up on a lot of new tactics just solely based on analysis. So here's what I found:

*   Unbundle existing platforms ([Zapier](/first-it-was-craiglist-next-its-zapier/), [Craigslist](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus), [AWS](https://www.tclauson.com/2019/09/11/Unbundling-AWS.html) etc)
*   [Unique and interesting domain names](https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/)
*   [Analysing market numbers with GTrends and FB Ads](https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/)
*   Turn popular book methods into apps (e.g: [5 Minute Journal](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/five-minute-journal/id1062945251))
*   Create directories for niche groups (e.g: [Glide Apps](https://community.glideapps.com/c/app-showcase), [Sheet2Site Showcase](https://www.sheet2site.com/showcase/))
*   [Analysing Google Keywords Searches](https://startupbook.net/)

If the above doesn't generate anything exciting for you. Try just calling up your friends and asking them about their day at work and what challenges they're having etc. People love to talk about their problems.
