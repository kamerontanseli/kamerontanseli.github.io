title: "Introducing 1-week self-help"
---

There's got to be at least more than 1 million self-help books out in the world now. For the majority of you, you've bought one. Was it good? Maybe.

The issue is that it's hard to find good self-help books with methods that actually work. Amazon reviews aren't to be trusted, GoodReads is pretty shit. So what do we have left to base our judgment on?

After reading a Wired article on the 4 Hour Work Week I realised how insightful the author's attempt was to journal the effectiveness of the self-help books. I began to wonder if this style of experimentation could be applied to other books...

So in the name of science, I'm creating a series called "1 Week Self-Help" where I attempt the methods from popular self-help books, document my journey, and rate them based on their effectiveness.
