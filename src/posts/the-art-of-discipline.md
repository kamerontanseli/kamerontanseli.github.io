There’s two types of discipline: external and internal. I strongly believe that you change your life when you learn to harness internal discipline.

## External Discipline
Self-help books are wonderful at giving us external discipline. The reinforcing words of the author telling us “we can be great”. That feeling in your chest that this time it’s going to be different. It’s all a short term fix.

When we read self-help books what we’re really looking for is a cheat method for obtaining internal discipline. However, in doing so we fail to actually grasp how internal discipline is formed.

I’ve sat in rooms with people who regularly read self-help books. They have read more books than I ever had and yet if you were to talk to them about their goals/dreams you’d soon find out they haven’t made any real significant progress towards them at all.

To further my point, I’ll give you an example from my childhood. My father is a brawny, 6ft 4, 242lb man from Turkey with a temper. Like his father, he was very strict, so therefore it made perfect sense for him to pass that strictness down to me. 

What my father wanted was for me to be disciplined like he was as a young man. Pushing those ideals onto me only gave me external discipline which made me rely on him shouting at me to give me the drive to do those things (the same reason why people hire personal trainers at the gym during January time). After a few weeks of work I gave up. I had no internal discipline to push me to want to be better.

## Internal Discipline
> Decision, a conclusion or resolution reached after consideration. - Oxford Dictionary

There comes a point in our lives when we decide to be truly better. We may have had enough of not being confident in ourselves or that we felt that our life was slipping away and we had not done enough in the time we had already spent. In other words, we want to be better.

However, the “want” has to become a “need”. That need has to be so great that you’ll do anything to achieve it. Without having a need you’ll always rely on the external discipline.

I can’t tell you exactly how to get this need (that would make me a self-help guru). But what I can say is that you should sit yourself down and have a real look at your life. Look at your books, look at your dreams, goals, and who you have around you. Then ask yourself  “am I working towards who I want to become?”.

My “need” was when I decided that I hated how I looked and started taking my nutrition seriously. The need to look great made eating sweet potatoes and lean turkey breast enjoyable because I knew every meal, every squat, every curl made me one step close to being shredded. After one year of eating 1,800kcal, walking 2 hours a day, working out 5x a week. I ended up becoming 70kg, 10% body fat, and 1000x more confident in life.

Another “need” of mine came about when I sat down and looked at my life. I worked so hard to get to such a point in my career and yet I felt not complete. The need to be a founder lead me to launching readercatch.com and starting the 12 in 12 challenge.

Finally, I do recommend that you use external discipline to top-up your internal discipline when you’re feeling down or overwhelmed. However, you must not rely solely on external discipline. Think of it like your headphones dying mid-workout. You relied on them and now you don’t have the discipline to finish your workout.
