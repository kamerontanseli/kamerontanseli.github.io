In the beginning of a startup's lifecycle there exists only the founders. One who is technical and is building the product, and the other who is selling/marketing the product. The technical founder will move fast, rapidly learning and iterating on the product to achieve product market fit.

As the startup scales and they begin to hire developers, marketers, and sales people. The iteration speed of the business begins to slow down. The product is then managed by product development teams who work on features the customer's have asked for. The marketers work on publishing content to the website and running advertisements, and the sales people do outreach to enterprise leads.
