Growth engineers are concerned with optimizing all stages of a self-serve business' funnel. Often this comes in the form of running small experiments within the product or marketing site, which the growth engineer will build and test themselves.

The aim of the growth engineer is to make small improvements (1-10%) to the funnel which add up over time. Unlike a product engineer who will aim to have a much larger impact (20-50%) to one stage of the funnel with a new feature launch.

Growth engineers also concern themselves with the internal operations of the business. For example, creating data pipelines from Segment to Salesforce in order to better personalize lifecycle emails, or writing scripts to backfill lead data to give sales better insight into the customers.

In order to become a growth engineer you'll need a few key skills:

1. A good understanding of SQL

No matter the reporting tool having a good understanding of SQL will allow you to pull up product usage data and find trends.

2. 1-3 years of engineering experience

Startups are a busy environment. Product engineering teams have schedules and roadmaps, and having to rely on them to build small experiments for you is a waste of their time. Instead being able to quickly jump into any part of the product and make the changes you want will save you, and the company time, and allow for rapid iteration based on learnings.

3. An understanding and love of digital marketing

Funnels, CTR, CPC, CLC, Page Score, etc. If you hate marketing you'll hate growth engineering. A growth engineer will be working alongside the CMO and other marketers, so you'll need an understanding of how the funnel operates and what metrics the marketing team are looking to improve.
