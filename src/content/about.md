My first job was at age fifteen at an agency in St Albans. I was helping in the creation of an in-house CMS as a junior full-stack Django developer. The CMS is still going strong today helping power sites such as Hexus and Cranble.

After two and a half years at the agency, I left to move to London. Joining a very early stage startup call Motivii as their lead front end engineer. With a team of only four, we were able to rewrite the entire product over the course of a year. Helping shift the aim of the product to our customer's more critical issues and reducing churn as a result.

Unfortunately, my time at Motivii would come to an end. Lack of funding forced me to leave after a year and join another young startup called Flux as their senior front end engineer. 

Although my title may mention frontend I spent quite a bit of time writing Node.js backend code. Integrations were the key drivers for the business so it made sense for me to fall into that style of work.

After an amazing company holiday to the Canary Islands and a quick getaway to Marrakech for my birthday, I left Flux.

Taking 3 months to myself I decided to build an app called Cycle Notes. A micro-studying app that breaks down notes and sends you paragraphs from them each day. I launched on ProductHunt and got over 70 upvotes, 300 visitors, and 50 signed up users.

Feeling somewhat happy with creating products I decided to try and apply to be a startup founder. My friend Franz, founder of TickDone referred me to Zinc VC, a social impact accelerator.

I applied and video recorded myself answering questions around how and why I cared about certain social issues. After a few weeks, I was invited to attend their in-person founder test. 

This involved a series of interviews, pitches, and team-based sessions. Which were all fun, especially the pitches. Unfortunately, I didn't get into the Zinc program but as with everything, life moves on.

I knew that I didn't want to be a front end developer again. I wanted to provide a bigger impact to the core metrics of a startup. After a few hours of research, I discovered a new type of work called growth engineering.

Luckily for me, Tray.io was also looking for someone in that line of work. After 3 interviews and a fun coding session, I became employee number 2 of Tray.io's growth team.
