Over the last two years, I've grown considerably more comfortable with statistics. It wasn't all plain sailing though, I've jumped between more than twenty books in order to piecemeal together an understanding of the topic.

Despite all the material out there in the interwebs, I never came across a no BS guide to doing statistics as a PM. Hence the need to write this material as a series of blog posts. I'm aiming to skip over almost all the math part and instead focus on using stats as a hammer for getting stuff done, rather than as a theoritical literature.

**Note: ** This guide is not for statisticians, it's for PMs who want to do data but aren't willing to spend the 2 years learning about math.

## Distributions

Distributions, often displayed as histograms (also as boxplots), count the frequency of values in your dataset. The most common distribution is the normal distribution, it follows a bell curve pattern (see the above image for context).

### Mean & Standard Deviation

The mean is the average value of your dataset. It is the highest point in your distribution as it contains the most frequent value.

The standard deviation is the distance of all the points in the distribution from the mean.

The mean +- 1 standard deviation, represents 65% of all the values in your distribution. The lower your standard deviation the more tight your distribution will become as the distance from the mean is smaller. Likewise the higher your standard deviation is the more spread out your distribution will be.
